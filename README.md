A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Damage Identification
### Task_1.2
Here we  have to identify the following things:

1) How many damages on the car-part.

2) Percentage of damage with respect to area of car part.


Following are the breakdowns:

1)Find polygons of the car-parts.

2)Find out how many parts are damaged and parts that are not damaged.

3)How many damages and what type are on the damaged parts .

4)After you have to calculate area of the damages on every damaged car part.

5)Then you have to find the percentage of the carpart damaged.

6)Bonus point if you could identify the part i.e. front driver side wheel, front Bumper etc.
